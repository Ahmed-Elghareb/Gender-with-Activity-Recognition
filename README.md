# Gender-with-Activity-Recognition

## Overview

Regarding the booming of big data and HAR in the scientific world, we conducted a research project that addresses the recognition of activities performed in addition to the gender of the performer. In this work, we present two models (hierarchical model and joint distribution model) and compare between two datasets (MoVi and MotionSense), using
only two IMU sensors on right and left hand and motion sense dataset using mobile phone, to predict gender with activity and see how every activity reflect on gender, and explore the efficiency on using autocorrelation function as a feature extractor and compare between three classifiers, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN).
